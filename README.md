# YojanaMitra – AI Agent Swarm for Government Scheme Access

## Full Idea  
YojanaMitra is an AWS Bedrock-powered multi-agent system to help underserved Indians (rural farmers, laborers, students) discover, understand, and apply for 100+ government schemes like PM-KISAN, Ayushman Bharat, NSP.  

Problem: 70-80% eligible miss benefits (NITI Aayog data) due to language barriers, complex forms, low awareness.  

Solution: Voice/text input in Hindi/regional langs. Agent swarm:  
- Eligibility Agent: RAG on scheme PDFs via Knowledge Bases.  
- Explanation Agent: Simple Hindi explanations.  
- Action Agent: Multimodal doc scan + PDF form drafts.  
- Proactive Agent: Reminders via Lambda.  

Tech: Bedrock Agents/Claude, Transcribe/Polly, serverless.  

## Why India Needs This  
Scales to 100M+ users, boosts scheme uptake 20-30%, aligns Viksit Bharat. Inspired by Raipur/Chhattisgarh rural gaps—real Bharat pain.
